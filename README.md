# De Re Publica Computational Analysis

This repository contains my code for a computational analysis of the De Re Publica.

Important files:

report/Final Report.pdf contains my report.

paragraphs.pdf contains the results of sentence clustering.

final_analysis.ipynb contains a Jupyter Notebook with the important code.

At some point I hope to organize the repository a bit.
